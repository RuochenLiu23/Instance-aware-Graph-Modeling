End-to-End Cell Detection via Instance-aware Graph Modeling
This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for cell detection and classification, which incorporates the dynamic graph to model the spatial and relational patterns among cell nuclei, thereby capturing the complex cellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment.
