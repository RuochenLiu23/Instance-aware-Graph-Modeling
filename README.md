## End-to-End Cell Detection via Instance-aware Graph Modeling

This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for cell detection and classification, which incorporates the dynamic graph to model the spatial and relational patterns among cell nuclei, thereby capturing the complex cellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment.

## Code Availability

## Current Status: 
The training configuration and parts of the code are temporarily withheld as the paper is currently under review.
